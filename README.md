# Automations
**Process Automations

**Process automations using Python:**

*For the first automation, I developed a notification system that will run on the back of the system and check for upcoming emails. The automation is expected to have the following features:*

- E-mail filters: to show notifications only from the desired e-mail addresses.
- Content filters: to show notifications from emails containing predefined keywords.
- Push notifications: to pop-up notifications no matter the window being used.
- Informative notifications: to show the mailer, some of the content and the keyword found (if applicable).

*The project will be developed in an agile fashion, therefore:*

- The tasks will be split into several spins.
- Only complete functionalities will be included on each commit.
- On each spin, a fully working and tested functionality will be pushed.
- Only working software will be reflected in the repository.
